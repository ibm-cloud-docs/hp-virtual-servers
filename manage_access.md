# Managing user access
{: #manage_access}

{{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} is deprecated. As of 18 August 2024, you canâ€™t create new instances, and access to free instances will be removed. Existing premium plan instances are supported until 31 January 2025. Any instances that still exist on that date will be deleted.
{: deprecated}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} service provides you with virtual servers on a highly
secure stack with an Ubuntu Linux operating system.
{: shortdesc}

A good practice is to have different operating-system-based users for each person or application, which is using the virtual server, having different permissions. Investigate which is the most suitable way for you to manage users and permissions.

Another good practice is to add users to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account and grant permissions to
them. This method provides the added users with capabilities within {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. For example, with specially granted permissions, a user can view the virtual server dashboards or manage (for example, delete)
virtual servers in specific resource groups or within your account.

Access to {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} service instances for users in your account is controlled by {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM) as described [here](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-iam-hpvs).
