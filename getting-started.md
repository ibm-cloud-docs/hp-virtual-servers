{: #getting-started}

{{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} is deprecated. As of 18 August 2024, you canâ€™t create new instances, and access to free instances will be removed. Existing premium plan instances are supported until 31 January 2025. Any instances that still exist on that date will be deleted.

{: tip}


Using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} service, you can provision virtual servers on a highly secure stack with an Ubuntu Linux operating system. On such a virtual server instance, you can run a myriad of Linux applications and containerized workloads.

This introduction informs you about the prerequisites for using this service. It points you to the process for provisioning a virtual server and informs you how to retrieve information about a created virtual server.

Finally, you find a reference to a description how to log in to your new virtual server.
{: shortdesc}


## Prerequisites
{: #gs_prerequisites}

For an overview of the features and advantages of this service, read [{{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} overview](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-overview).

Before you start with {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}}:
- Make sure that you have an [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started){: external}.
- If you want to use a {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} paid plan, you require a [Pay-As-You-Go account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account){: external}. To check your account type, go to [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external} and click **Management** > **Account** > **Account settings**.
- Check whether you are using the [required browser software](/docs/overview?topic=overview-prereqs-platform) for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
- Have an SSH key pair ready, which you need for creating and connecting to your virtual server instance. Read [Generating SSH keys](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-generate_ssh) for more information.


## Provisioning a {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} instance
{: #gs_provisioning}

You create a virtual server instance in a few steps from the user interface on the {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} page.
Read [Provisioning a virtual server](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-provision) for detailed information.

## Retrieving virtual server information
{: #gs_retrieving}

After you created an instance of {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}}, you can check the detailed information of your virtual server.
Read [Retrieving information about a virtual server](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-retrieve-info-vs) for more information.

## Connecting to a new virtual server
{: #gs_logging}

From your client workstation, you can connect to a virtual server that exists on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with its public IP address and your corresponding private SSH key. Read the information in [Connecting to a new virtual server](/docs/services/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-connect_vs).

## Managing user access
{: #gs_useraccess}

{:help: data-hd-content-type='help'}
{:support: data-reuse='support'}

Access to the management of {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} service instances is controlled by IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) but the servers use standard Ubuntu user-access management. You can find more information [here](/docs/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-manage_access).

## Securing your data
{: #gs_secure}

To securely manage your data when you use {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}}, you must know what data is stored and encrypted and how to delete any personal data. You can find more information about how to protect your data and the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} network architecture [here](/docs/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-mng-data).

## Protecting your {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}}
{: #gs_protect}

A {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} server has two disks, "boot" and "data". The boot disk is always 25 GB. If your boot disk is full, the server can't start. You can't recover your instance because your boot disk can't be resized.
The size of the data disk varies, and depends on your plan. Make sure that important data is persisted on the data disk. After the user password expires, you have 30 days to change your password. If you don't change your password within the 30 days, your account becomes inactive and you can't log in by way of SSH even if you are using SSH-keys. For more information, see [Protecting a virtual server](/docs/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-protect_vs).
