# Learning about {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} architecture and workload isolation
{: #learn-architecture}

{{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} is deprecated. As of 18 August 2024, you canâ€™t create new instances, and access to free instances will be removed. Existing premium plan instances are supported until 31 January 2025. Any instances that still exist on that date will be deleted.
{: deprecated}

Review the following sample architecture for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}}, and learn more about different isolation levels so that you can choose the solution that best meets the requirements of the workloads that you want to run in the cloud.

## {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} architecture

![{{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} architecture](image/hpvs_architecture-overview.svg "{{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} architecture overview"){: caption="Figure 1. {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} architecture overview" caption-side="bottom"}


The {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} architecture is divided into two major areas:
1. The **Z as a Service (ZaaS)** infrastructure as shown in Figrure 1 is used to host the {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}}. This infrastructure is deployed as multi-zone regions, where each region consists of three zones. In every region, you can deploy virtual servers on one of the many IBM LinuxONE systems available. These systems can be reached by way of SSH over the public network.
2. The second part of the picture shows the **{{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} Management** stack. The key component is the {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} service broker, which is used to create and manage your virtual servers. You can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog to interact with this component to provision a virtual server. After that you can use the {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} dashboard to view details about the virtual server you created.

## {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} workload isolation
{: #workload_isolation}

As shown in Figure 2, the IBM LinuxONE systems which are used for the {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} are partitioned into several Logical Partitions (LPARs). A host system, which is protected by the IBM Secure Service Container technology is installed on each partition. IBM Secure Service Container technology provides protection against insider threats, for example, IBM Cloud administrators. Protection achieved by the following features:
* The host system supports interactions for administrators by way of well-defined encrypted REST APIs with only a limited set of secure configuration options. No other connection is available. For example, SSH is not available.
* The IBM Secure Service Container implements a secure boot procedure to detect potential attacks against the installation image, which ensures that only untampered images are started.
* All disks, which are attached to the IBM Secure Service Container host system are automatically encrypted according to AES256. The encryption keys are stored in the protected host.
* IBM LinuxONE Hardware Management Console functions, which examine the processor or memory state are not available for partitions that are protected by the IBM Secure Service Container technology.

Figure 2. shows that every host system is shared between multiple {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} that are owned by multiple tenants. The KVM hypervisor isolates the virtual servers, and each virtual server has its own virtualized network connection.

| {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_full}} | This service manages the TLS certificates that are used for the service broker. |
| {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisfull}} with LogDNA | The {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} service broker sends service logs to {{site.data.keyword.loganalysisfull_notm}} with LogDNA. These logs are monitored and analyzed by the service team to detect service issues and malicious activities. |
| {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull}} | {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} integrates with {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull_notm}} to forward audit events to the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailfull_notm}} service. |
| {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}} | The {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} service broker sends service metrics to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}. These metrics are monitored by the service team to identify capacity and performance issues of the service. |
| {{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} | To authenticate requests to the service and authorize user actions, {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} uses {{site.data.keyword.iamshort}} (IAM) operating system and service access roles. For more information about the IAM permissions that are required to work with the service, see [Managing access for {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}}](/docs/hp-virtual-servers?topic=hp-virtual-servers-iam-hpvs). |
| {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} | {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} is using the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} to host the service broker and the dashboard UI. |
| {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb_full}} | {{site.data.keyword.hpvs}} uses the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-mongodb_full_notm}} to store the metadata about virtual servers to manage those containers. |
